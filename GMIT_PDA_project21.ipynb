    "### Introduction\n",
    "For this the real world phenonemon I have chose to investigate factors influencing the diaganosis of alcolholism. I will investigate a range of factors that may cause alcoholism and simulate a dataset from that.\n",
    "The dataset will represent a simulated sample of subjects each of whom have been diagnosed as suffering from alcoholism. For each subject I will simulated a measure for the each given influecing factor, which follows a particular data distributin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investigation into factors that may cause alcoholism.\n",
    "\"There is no singular cause of alcoholism. In fact, there are dozens of risk factors that play a role in the development of an alcohol addiction. These risk factors interact differently in every individual, leading to alcohol use disorders in some and not in others.\" (Malibu, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors that could contribute to alcoholims included:\n",
    "#### Familial/genetic factors - i.e. social or biological inheritance. \n",
    "For example, one or more parent had alcoholism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age \n",
    "Age is an impontant factor in the the idenficitaiton of alcolholism, the younger the subject the more likely they are to be be diagnosed with alcoholism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Age.png)(NIAAA Publications, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Addional to age of subject (when diagnosed) is age of subject when they first started drinking. Those closer to the age of 15 when they first start drinking are more likely to delvelop a harmful relationship with alcohol. "
