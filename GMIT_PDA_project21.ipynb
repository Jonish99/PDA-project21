    "### Introduction\n",
    "For this the real world phenonemon I have chose to investigate factors influencing the diaganosis of alcolholism. I will investigate a range of factors that may cause alcoholism and simulate a dataset from that.\n",
    "The dataset will represent a simulated sample of subjects each of whom have been diagnosed as suffering from alcoholism. For each subject I will simulated a measure for the each given influecing factor, which follows a particular data distributin.\n",

    "### Investigation into factors that may cause alcoholism.\n",
    "\"There is no singular cause of alcoholism. In fact, there are dozens of risk factors that play a role in the development of an alcohol addiction. These risk factors interact differently in every individual, leading to alcohol use disorders in some and not in others.\" (Malibu, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors that could contribute to alcoholims included:\n",
    "#### Familial/genetic factors - i.e. social or biological inheritance. \n",
    "For example, one or more parent had alcoholism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age \n",
    "Age is an impontant factor in the the idenficitaiton of alcolholism, the younger the subject the more likely they are to be be diagnosed with alcoholism. As alcohol is a known contributor to early death, the fall of the incidence of alcoholism in older age groups may well be  \n",

However, interestingly the graphic also show that after from the age 30-39 age group females are ever more less likley to have a high indicdence of alcohol consumption. Whilst with males from 20-29 the high incidence of drinking is more likey to rise until the 60-69 age group. This suggests that males are far more likley to be heavy drinkers than female and that that likelyhood increases until late middle age. \n",
