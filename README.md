When you think of an interaction, a social interaction or a drug interaction might come to mind. But did you know that there might be an interaction amongst the variables in your research? In statistics, an interaction is a special property of three or more variables, where two or more variables interact to affect a third variable in a non-additive manner. In other words, the two variables interact to have an effect that is more than the sum of their parts.

The most common interaction you are likely to see is as part of a mixed-models ANOVA. In this technique, you have two groups (typically a treatment and control groupâ€”but it could be gender, junior/senior, low exercise/high exercise) who are both measured on a single continuous dependent variable two or more times (also known as repeated measures).

What is a variable in analysis?
Variables are units of data that can change between different cases. The different values that a variable can take affect the type of analysis that is possible. Variables can be analysed on their own (univariate analysis), with one other variable (bivariate analysis) or with a number of others (multivariate analysis)

Moral of the story: When there is a statistically significant interaction between a categorical and continuous variable, the rate of increase (or the slope) for each group within the categorical variable is different.

What kind of regression is in flight delay analysis


###########
1. research

2. developing the random data set
What is the iteraction between each varialbe and flight time?
what is the interaction between each variable with each other?

Different ramdom set for each variable, how will that work?
how can this be plotted, 
How can this help predict flight delays?
